1. Tell me about yourself
Hello, my name is Shubham Naresh Patel. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and 1.7 years of experience as a front-end developer, mainly working with React and React Native. I specialize in building responsive and interactive user interfaces. I also have knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve worked on over 7 projects in collaboration with a team.

One of my key projects was RelphaCare, a healthcare app that allows real-time tracking and communication between doctors, patients, and families. I developed the complete UI, including features like a custom calendar, PDF reports, and health charts.

I also worked on Yogananda Daily, an app available on the Play Store. I built the entire UI, integrated APIs, and added a dark mode. The app displays daily inspirational quotes by Paramhansa Yogananda.

I enjoy learning new technologies and working in a team environment.
